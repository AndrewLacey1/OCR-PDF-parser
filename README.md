# OCR-PDF-parser
This project was designed to automate the process of separating scanned PDFs by each page and renaming them as their serial number.
## Motivation
My employer at the time expressed a desire to automate the process, and assigned me to do it. As this was not personal project, continued maintenance is not currently planned.
